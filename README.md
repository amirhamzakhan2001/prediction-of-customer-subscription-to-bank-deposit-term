# prediction-of-customer-subscription-to-bank-deposit-term
Your client is a retail banking institution. Term deposits are a major source of income for a bank. A term deposit is a cash investment held at a financial institution. Your money is invested for an agreed rate of interest over a fixed amount of time, or term. The bank has various outreach plans to sell term deposits to their customers such as email marketing, advertisements, telephonic marketing and digital marketing. Telephonic marketing campaigns still remain one of the most effective way to reach out to people. However, they require huge investment as large call centers are hired to actually execute these campaigns. Hence, it is crucial to identify the customers most likely to convert beforehand so that they can be specifically targeted via call. You are provided with the client data such as : age of the client, their job type, their marital status, etc. Along with the client data, you are also provided with the information of the call such as the duration of the call, day and month of the call, etc. we have to predict if the client will subscribe to term deposit  or not.
to predict that the client will subscribe or not you have to import the necessary libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn e.t.c.

Load the data and find the shape of both csv file.

Generate the hypothesis and identify the variable types.

we have to plot the graph to visualise that how many peaople subscribe it.

Plot the graph to visualise,which job group and which age people belong the most.

Plot the graph to visualise, how many people have default history.

Plot the graph to visualise, which job group subcribe percentage are high.

Plot the graph to visualise, how many people have default history from the subscriber.

Plot the graph to visualise, which variable has highly impact on subscribe.

Apply logistic regression and decision tree from machine learning algorithms and get accuracy.

Save the highest accuracy score in the submission.csv.

Copy the subscribe variable from submission.csv in solution_checker.xlsx to get the accuracy score of subscription i.e. in the rate_of_subscription_of_deposit.csv
